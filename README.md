# Mowgli
Mowgli is a sidestep from the LIAM-project. It uses analog perimeter sensors to be able to determine how far from the perimeter it is and to make it track it smoothly.

The hardware is identical to LIAM, except I upgraded to Arduino MEGA 2560 and don't use the Morgan-shield for perimeter sensors.
